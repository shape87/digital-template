<h2>Impending Lava Death 3</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get your character to jump from platform to platform in order to reach the goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To immerse the player in a themed environment and display comcial animation with platforming familiarity.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Action  Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Jump from platform to platform in order to get Preston the Robot to the goal before time runs out.  Press the arrow keys to move, and space to long jump.  
You have three lives.  It is suggested to jump when the platforms move fast because they may throw you off.  Also, vertical moving platforms tend to bounce
the character upwards, trying walking to stay level and jump before the platform gets too high.

Reach the end
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Immersive environment, addictive gameplay, quick paced platforming fun.
</li>

Preston the Robot is researching a volcano so his lazy schoolboy owner Jimmy can do a book report.  Next thing you know, Preston falls inside but luckliy
lands on a platform.  Can Preston find his way out so his moron owner can get a C- on his assignment?
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Preston the overly optimistic robot will try anything to get his schoolboy owner Jimmy to do some studying for his book report on volcanos.  With no options left Preston decided to go to the volcano himself while little Jimmy sits around and watches other people play video games streaming which is apparently a thing for some $%^$ing reason.
Once at the volcano Preston slips and falls in.  Will Preston escape, or will he melt, leaving his robot spirit to ingest its own tears?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers trying to have fun and appreciate simple games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
30 seconds to 90 seconds unless you are really bad.
</li>

Be patient, the platforms can move at random or send you high to the ceiling which may throw off your jump.  Walk with the vertical platforms to stay level instead of bouncing upward.
